# Database GUI
This GUI was created for CSCI 3432 Database Systems. It connects to a MySQL instance hosted on AWS and retrieves data regarding student organizations. The data in these tables is fictional. In order to run this solution, the nuget packages "MySQL.Data" and "CommunityToolkit.WinUI.UI.Controls.DataGrid" must be installed. 

When the application is started, all buttons are disabled except the login button.

Once the user is successfully logged in, the login button is disabled, the table on the currently selected tab is populated with the appropriate data, and all other buttons and textfields are enabled. Each tab has buttons for ‘add’, ‘modify’, and ‘delete’, as well as a search feature that allows the user to search by individual or multiple fields.

The ‘add’ button displays a content dialog window that allows the user to input data for each field. This data is then used to add a row to the table through the use of stored procedures.
